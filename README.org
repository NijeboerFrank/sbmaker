#+title: sbmaker

=sbmaker= (Second Brain Maker) is a simple command line application that allows
users to quickly create a directory structure according to [[https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/][The PARA Method: A
Universal System for Organizing Digital Information]] by Tiago Forte.

Currently, you can use =sbmaker= to create or remove the PARA system from the
current working directory. In the future, you can hopefully do more with the
methods from the book!
